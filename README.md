# Flybridge Investment Memorandum Generator

## Overview
The Flybridge memo generator tool helps turn decks, business plans, and call notes into a first-draft VC investment memo for AI startups. For founders, it offers insights into how VCs might evaluate your business and simplifies the process of presenting your company to investors by creating a draft memo based on the information provided. To get the most accurate results, provide as much context as possible. A helpful tip is to record your pitch and upload the transcript along with any supporting materials.

## Limitations
The memo generator produces a strong draft addressing key investor considerations but serves as a starting point, not a finished product. It covers 50-60% of the work, requiring human input for nuance and judgment. The tool may reflect biases in the input and is limited by OpenAI's o1 model. Competitor analysis provides initial insights but should be supplemented with additional research, and market size estimates should include a separate bottoms-up analysis. This tool is for informational purposes only.
